Free Feedburner Alternative and RSS Redirect plugin from S-Feeds.com. 

== Description ==
This plugin is your "one click"-solution to switch from Feedburner to the FREE Feedburner alternative S-Feeds.com. Don't wait for the Feedburner shutdown, switch today, S-Feeds.com is the better feedburner alternative.

The plugin is very easy to use: 

- Step 1: Download, install & activate it
- Step 2: Click on "Apply redirect" for all feeds you want to redirect (most likely your main feed, as well as some comments & author feeds you may have)

Once the redirect is active, your RSS-url will redirect to your new feed page where users can subscribe to your feed. 

If you had former Feedburner subscribers, follow the steps as prompted in the plugin to move them over to your new feed (RSS as well as Email subscribers).
