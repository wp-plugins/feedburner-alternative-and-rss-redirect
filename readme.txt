Free Feedburner Alternative and RSS Redirect plugin from S-Feeds.com. 

== Description ==
This plugin allows you to easily switch from Feedburner to the FREE (and better) Feedburner alternative S-Feeds.com.  

Read all about the service on http://www.s-feeds.com/rss.

The plugin is very easy to use: 

- Step 1: Download, install & activate it
- Step 2: Click on "Apply redirect" for all feeds you want to redirect (most likely your main feed, as well as some comments & author feeds you may have)
- Step 3: Connect it to a s-feeds.com account to get access to your subscribers, see statistics etc. (see screenshots) 

Once the redirect is active, your RSS-url will redirect to your new feed page where users can subscribe to your feed. 

If you had former Feedburner subscribers, follow the steps as prompted in the plugin to move them over to your new feed (RSS as well as Email subscribers). 

== Installation ==
Extract the zip file and drop the contents into the wp-content/plugins/ directory of your WordPress installation. Then activate the plugin from the plugins page.

Then go to plugin settings page and click on "Apply redirect" for all feeds you want to redirect. 

== Screenshots ==

1. After installing the plugin, you'll see this button (on the plugin's settings screen) - click on it to apply the redirect 

2. Your new feed page where users can subscribe

3. Your subscribers have plenty of options how they want to subscribe. For example, they can filter your feed to only get stories with certain tags, keywords, or authors (screenshot shows the tag-filter). 

4. Subscribers can also select if they prefer to receive only headlines, or the entire content (provided you selected your RSS feed contains this information, otherwise it's just snippets). 

5. Subscribers can also choose via which channels messages should be delivered to them 

6. Statitics about your subscribers 

7. Statistics showing how many messages have been sent via "Newspapers" or "Single emails"

8. User demographics statistics about your subscribers
